[![icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,nextjs,tailwind)]()

## About
Uhmmmmmm... just a small photos project I guess...
If you have any ideas for the name please send us (this project has the most generic ahhh name I've ever seen)
Basically a image reviewer from specific dates. Built using Next.js and tailwind. It will probably have a good design (if we feel like doing it) but yeah thats it.

## Recommendations
Installing a tailwind intelisense plugin (VSCode). Actually using the docs (ik its hard but we must use them). Writing good code (also hard but less hard but still hard)

## Docs
[tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)

[next docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) (quite important)

I think thats it...

## For devs:
Running the dev server (very basic)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Installing required things for node 
```bash
npm install
```

Add something here if its gonna be useful later.

## Things we need
- better icon
- better name
- better code
- better developers
