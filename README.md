## About
Uhmmmmmm... just a small photos project I guess...
Basically a image reviewer from specific dates. Built using Next.js and tailwind. It will probably have a good design (if we feel like doing it) but yeah thats it.

## Recommendations
Installing a tailwind intelisense plugin (VSCode)
Actually using the docs (ik its hard but we must)
Writing good code (also hard but less hard but still hardw)

## Docs
[![tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)]
[![next docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)] (quite important)
I think thats it tbh...

## For devs:
Running the dev server (very basic)
```bash
npm run dev
```
